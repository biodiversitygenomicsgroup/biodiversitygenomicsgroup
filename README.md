We are a group of biologists primarily interested in studying the evolution of natural populations with a major focus on understanding species’ responses to climate change and habitat alterations. Our research largely relies on genome-wide data obtained through various next generation sequencing protocols from field sampling, museum collections as well as archaeological samples. We leverage the power of big data by collating information from comparative genomics, population genomics, phylogenomics, behavioral ecology, and ecological niche modeling to implement a holistic research paradigm aimed to facilitate the management of wildlife when entwined with human welfare.
